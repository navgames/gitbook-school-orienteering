## Intro

Orienteering is following instructions to find things. Today the students will practice following instructions to gather. They will find things. They will give instructions for someone else to find things.

Following instructions is important to further establish the teacher-student relationship and create a functional environment for the rest of the semester. Today's games also provides an opportunity for the students to move around in the space, and have fun seeking out hidden objects.

## Main Activities

[Gathering Game](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fnavgames.force.com%2Factivities%2Fs%2Fdetail%2Fa2j1K0000014rLlQAI&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFstMxIY9RLXhNucHlcQC3ygP6YQg): Students practice gathering methods such as by listening for a whistle, watching the teacher, or by paying attention to their classmates.

[Treasure Hunt](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fnavigationgames.lightning.force.com%2Flightning%2Fr%2FActivity__c%2Fa2j1K0000014rMoQAI%2Fview&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEP8FA7gQa33ePb5tQjcxRjGIovfw): Students try to find treasures throughout a space. Depending on the age of the students, they may do this only with verbal hints and clues, or they may even sketch a map or picture of the treasure's location for their partner to find. There are many variations on this activity. Occasionally interrupt the activity to have the students practice gathering.

## Notes

Once students know how to do treasure hunt, this can be used a back-pocket activity throughout the rest of the semester. The Gathering method should be practiced and used at every class.
