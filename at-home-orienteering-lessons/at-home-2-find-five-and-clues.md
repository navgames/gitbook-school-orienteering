### **Learning Goals**

* Paying attention to surroundings
* Spatial Memory
* Spatial Vocabulary
  * **Closer/Farther**
  * **Left/Right**
  * **Above/Below**
  * **In Front/Behind**
  * **Beside/Between**
* Orienteering vocabulary
  * **Course Setter**: the person who hides the objects
  * **Orienteer**: the person who finds the objects

### Materials

5 objects for hiding: These may be as large as stuffed animals, as small as coins, or any combination.  You should be able to carry all five objects at once, to make it easier to hide them.

### Location

This game is designed to be played using several rooms in your house. It can also be played outside.

### Safety

Do not place objects in unsafe places.  

Pay attention moving around, so you don't hurt yourself or break anything.

### The Games

Get ready: Collect 5 objects. Find a partner to play with. Agree on the space you will use. For example, you may use the living room, your bedroom, the hallway, and the kitchen. 

1. Game 1: **Find Five**
   * Your partner will be the Course Setter and you will be the Orienteer. Have the Course Setter place the five objects in plain sight throughout your space. Do not peek! Then it is your turn to find the objects. How long does it take you?
   * Switch. You become the Course Setter and place the objects, and your partner is the Orienteer and will find the objects.
2. Game 2: **Clues**
   * Have the Course Setter place just TWO objects in new locations. This time the objects can be harder to find. Have the Course Setter give two clues, one for each object. The clues should use words like above, below, left, right, next to, in front of, behind, beside, far, near, on top of, underneath. Now, the Orienteer finds the two objects in the same order as the two clues.
   * Switch roles between the Course Setter and Orienteer, and play again. Continue to switch back and forth, increasing the number of objects hidden at one time, until you can remember clues for all five objects at once, in order.

### Reflection

* What strategies did you use to find the objects in the **Find Five**, when you had no clues?
* Were you faster at finding objects in the **Clues** game?
* Which objects were easier to find, and why?
* Which locations were hardest to remember?
* What strategies did you use to remember the clues?
* How many clues could you remember easily?
* Do you prefer being the **Course Setter** or the **Orienteer**?

### Do More

* In **Find Five**: Get clues to the location of the objects while looking. For example, the Course Setter might say "warmer" or "colder" depending on whether the Orienteer is getting closer or further from one of the objects.
* **Course Setting Clues**: One person describes a location using words, and the other person places an object in that location. The describer confirms whether or not the location was correct.
