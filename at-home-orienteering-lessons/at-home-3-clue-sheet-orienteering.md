### **Introduction**

"Today we will make **clue sheets** and use them to find **checkpoints** on a course. Each course will have a different **clue sheet**. Your challenge will be to find the fastest route for each course."

### **Learning Goals**

* Following a sequence
* Spatial Memory
* Vocabulary
  * **Route**: the path you take to get to all the objects
  * **Course**: a set of objects to visit in order, along with a start and finish location
  * **Clue sheet**: a list of symbols telling you which objects to visit, and in what order
  * **Checkpoint**: A landmark or significant location in the space

### **Materials**

* 5 Objects: These should be easy to see, approximately the size of a stuffed animal or larger.
* Paper
* Pencil
* Scissors
* A Partner

### Safety

Do not run with scissors. Remember when passing scissors to others to hold them with the sharp ends pointing toward yourself, not the other person.

Pay attention when moving through the space so you don't hurt yourself or break anything.

What are the rules for moving around in your space? Are you allowed to run? If not, then walk!

Be careful to avoid objects and obstacles in the space. Agility is the ability to move quickly and easily, especially in a place where footing is uneven or there are obstacles. Be agile! Be nimble!

### Activity

* **Set Up**
  * Identify 5 unique objects in the space. These can be anything from a table or TV to a stuffed animal or plate of cookies. These objects will be your **checkpoints**.
  * Write down the name or sketch an image of each **checkpoint** into multiple columns on a sheet of paper. Each column should include 1 of each **checkpoint**, although the order of **checkpoints** should be different for each one.
  * Cut each column into individual strips of paper. These are your **clue sheets**.
  * _Here are some example clue sheets_:

* Game 1: **Clue Sheet Orienteering**
  * For each **clue sheet**, the objective is to visit the checkpoints in the order they appear on the sheet. Record your time for each course.
  * Once you're completed all courses, run them again and see if your time improves.

### Reflection

1. Did the activity get easier over time? Why might this be?
2. Were some courses easier than others?
3. Without looking, can you describe where each object is?

### Do More

* Try moving around some of the objects between each round. How does the game grow more difficult as the number of objects moved increases?
* This activity can be done outdoors by assigning symbols to tables, benches, trees, and other objects.
