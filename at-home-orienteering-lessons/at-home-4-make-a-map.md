### Introduction

"Today we will draw a map of the space, learn how to keep it **oriented**, and use it to find hidden objects."

### Learning Goals

* Vocabulary 
  * **Orientation \(Orient\)**: \(In orienteering\) Rotating the map until it matches the space
  * **Scale**: The size of something on a map compared to real life

### **Materials**

* 5 Objects: These should be easy to see, approximately the size of a stuffed animal or larger.
* Paper
* Pencil & Eraser

### Safety

Pay attention when moving through the space so you don't hurt yourself or break anything.

### Activity

* **Set Up: Draw a Map**

  * Sketch a map of your space in pencil as though you are looking down from the ceiling. Start with an outline of the space and then add objects from largest to smallest. Keep the map simple by leaving out smaller items such as lamps, vases, etc. You can add more details later if you want. You may add labels to objects if it helps.
  * Pay attention to **scale** when drawing the map. For example, if there is a couch in the room that goes halfway along a wall, then draw it on the map so that it takes up the same amount of space.
  * Consider tracing over your map with a pen, as you will be drawing and erasing circles for some of the games.

* Game 1: **Orienting the Map**

  * Walk around the space, while keeping your map **oriented**. This means that the map should always be facing the same direction no matter which way your body is facing. Remember to rotate your body around the map as you move so that it stays matched up.
  * At random moments, throw the map in the air and let it fall to the ground. Pick up the map, and **orient** it to the space before continuing to move.

* Game 2: **Map Find Five**
  * Place the five objects around the space, and draw a circle on the map for each object. 
  * Pass the map to someone else, and ask them to collect the objects by using the map.
  * Switch roles and play again. Make sure the person finding the objects does not look when they are being hidden.

### Reflection

1. What was challenging about drawing the map? Were some objects harder to include than others?
2. How could you tell if the map was oriented to the space?
3. Was the other person able to effectively use your map? What parts of your map were confusing to them, and what parts were clear?

### Do More

Try redrawing the map of the room, but this time from different perspectives \(angles\). Which perspectives are easiest to understand? Which are easiest to draw? Which do you think is the best perspective?
