# 7: Neighborhood Course

### Learning Goals

Orienteering with a map

### Safety

Please be careful of cars, weather, and current social distancing advisories. Do not go outside if conditions are unsafe. 

Wear clothing suitable for the weather. Is it raining? Wear a raincoat!

### Activity

#### Set Up

Choose a hydrant course from the list on [www.navigationgames.org](https://www.navigationgames.org/neighborhood-map-courses). You can choose the one that starts closest to your house.

Download the PDF map for the course onto a phone or tablet. Open the corresponding Google Form for that course. You will fill out the form as you complete the course. You may choose to print materials if you have access to a printer.

#### Game

The objective for these courses is to visit the checkpoints in the order they are marked on the map, starting from the triangle.

When you arrive at each checkpoint, there should be a fire hydrant in real life. Open the Google Form for the course, and respond to the question about the color of the hydrant based on what you see. It is okay to make mistakes \(this is a challenging activity!\).

Submit your answers when you finish the entire course.

Repeat as many time with as many different courses as you wish!

### Reflection

Which checkpoints were the hardest to find? What made them hard?

How did you decide how to get from one checkpoint to another?

Did you make any mistakes while navigating? If so, why do you think those mistakes occurred? Were you able to fix any of your mistakes during the course? How did you fix them?

### Do More

Complete as many courses as you want! The courses are scattered throughout Cambridge, so there's always someplace new to go!
