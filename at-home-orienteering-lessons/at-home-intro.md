# Introduction: At-Home Orienteering

These progressive games for kids, parents, and teachers can be done at home or at school. The games focus on exploring, spatial memory, and understanding maps.

| Lesson | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Find Five and Clues](at-home-2-find-five-and-clues.md) | Hide and find objects |
| [Features and Symbols](at-home-1.md) | Use symbols to represent objects |
| [Clue Sheet Orienteering](at-home-3-clue-sheet-orienteering.md) | Visit the objects in the sequence shown on your clue sheet |
| [Make a Map](at-home-4-make-a-map.md) | Draw a map and mark the object locations |
| [Indoor Courses](at-home-5-indoor-courses.md) | Keep your map oriented while you do a course |

Each lesson includes sections on learning goals, vocabulary, safety and reflection. We start each lesson with a comic strip and an introduction.
