# Introduction: At-Home Orienteering

In the spring of 2020, schools were closed in response to the covid-19 virus pandemic. For kids, parents and teachers, Navigation Games prepared these progressive lessons that can be done at home. The lessons focus on exploring a space looking for objects, spatial memory, representing objects and spaces with written maps, orienting maps, and using maps to find objects. Along the way we talk about scale, legends \(keys\), route choice, and what it feels like to build up a mental map of a space. 

The lessons culminate with orienteering outside in your neighborhood \(if you live in Cambridge, MA\). Do practice social distancing, and check on the latest information from your local authorities to determine whether it is OK to walk around your neighborhood. If you are in a different town and would like to collaborate to create neighborhood orienteering courses where you live, please get in touch. 

These lessons are under active development. Our programming and business has taken a severe hit due to covid-19; if you enjoy these lessons, please consider making a [donation to Navigation Games](https://donorbox.org/donate-to-navigation-games). We are a 501\(c\)\(3\) non-profit. Also, please send us an email \([admin@navigationgames.org](mailto:admin@navigationgames.org)\) with your feedback!
