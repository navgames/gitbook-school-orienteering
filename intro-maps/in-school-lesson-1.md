# In-School Lesson 1

## Learning Goals

### SHAPE America Standards:&#x20;

* S2E1.3: Engages actively in the activities of physical education class without teacher prompting
* S4E3.3: Accepts and implements specific corrective feedback from teacher
* S4.E1.3: Exhibits personal responsibility in teacher-directed activities
* S4E4.3a: Praises others for their success in movement performance
* S4E5.3: Recognizes the role of rules and etiquette in physical activity with peers

### Standards Based Objectives:

Students will be able to:

* Remember and stay within a boundary
* Gather in response to teacher’s signal
* Show awareness of others; respect personal space while moving in general space
* Establish pattern of completing an activity faster on repeated tries
* Communicate which way to go with a partner using directions
* Use orienteering specific vocabulary: Boundary, Orienteering, during activities
* Visit checkpoints in order
* Learn to use the electronic timing equipment for orienteering (Clear, Start, course in order, Finish, Download)

* Have a method ready for assigning pairs
* Map of the area (optional: master map with locations of name tags)
* 10 cones with animal pictures on them
* 4 different colored poly spots
* 5-animal and 10-animal picture cards
* Geometric Animal-O maps
* Set up Animal-O according to the configuration on the map
* Whiteboard, eraser, whiteboard markers
* Whistle (for gathering if needed)

## **Introduction for Students**

“Orienteering is a sport where you run around and find things using clues. It’s important to know how to be safe when you are orienteering.”\


## **Activities**

The extensions can be used with extra time or older students.

1. Run the boundary&#x20;
   * Teach the word “Boundary”. Explain that you will run the boundary for today’s activities, and that everyone should pay attention to where you go. They must always stay inside the boundary.
   * Have the students follow in a well-formed line as you run the boundary.
   * Check their understanding: ask them to name things that are inside the boundary (e.g. that tree, that rock), and outside the boundary (e.g. the street, that fire hydrant). Draw attention to any areas within the boundary that should be avoided as well (e.g. the flower beds).
2. Animal-O
   * Students take a strip of paper depicting all of the animals shown on the cones in order from first to last.
   * Encourage students to remember which animals are where, although they do not have to have them memorized.
3. (Remove any cones not used for Geometric Animal-O Lvl. 1)
4. Map introduction with whiteboard
   * Draw a map of the cones on a whiteboard, but draw several cones out of place. Ask the students how to fix the map.
   * Talk about parts of the map. Discuss how students can identify different cones based on their relative position to one-another. (e.g. “The cone all by itself,” “The cones in a line/square,” “The cone by the blue spot.”)
   * Rotate the map so it is no longer oriented in the same direction as the cones. Ask the students if the map is correct each time it is rotated. Can anyone explain why the map needs to be pointed (oriented) a certain way?
5. Geometric Animal-O Lvl. 1
   * Pass out stickers and maps with blank circles matching the locations of the cones. Have students place the stickers on the map to match that animal’s location.
   * When students are finished with their maps, have them compare with one-another to see if they have the same solutions. If their maps are different, have them discuss why that is, and what needs to be changed.
6. Place cones to match a new map
   * Redraw the whiteboard to reflect a different setup of cones.
   * Assign each student (or pair of students) an animal cone, and indicate where it should go on the new map.
   * Once all cones are placed, review with the class if each cone is correct. Address any mistakes, and give groups who placed their cone incorrectly a chance to adjust their placement.
7. Extension: Geometric Courses
   * Pass out courses using the Geometric Animal-O arrangement. (The map should NOT show the location of each animal, only the cones.)
   * Students visit the cones in the order indicated by the map.
   * They may complete as many different courses, or repeat courses, as they wish.
8. Hand out the worksheet. Tell the students that we will review the answers at the next class.

## **Wrap-Up**

* Discussion:&#x20;
  * Was it ever challenging to keep your map matching the cones? Why was that?&#x20;
  * What happened if the map was no longer oriented to match the cones? Why does it make a difference?
  * Did you change anything about how you moved to make sure your map always faced the correct direction?
  * How could you tell if you were in the right place or not?
  * What sort of mistakes did people make? Why did those mistakes occur? How did you figure out what to do after making a mistake?
