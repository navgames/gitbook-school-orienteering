# In-School Lesson 4

## Learning Goals

### SHAPE America Standards:&#x20;

* S2E2.3: Recognizes locomotor skills specific to a wide variety of physical activities.
* S2E5.3a: Applies simple strategies and tactics in chasing activities
* S4E2.3: Works independently for extended periods of time

### Standards Based Objectives:

Students will be able to:

* Complete a course in order, with start, controls, finish, and check-in
* Recall landmarks in order to build a mental map of the controls
* Execute timed activities faster each time by practicing to get faster
* Identify aspects of a map to show understanding
* Match map symbols with corresponding objects in real life
* Use an electronic timing system with minimal help from the teacher (if used)

## Materials and Set-Up

* Isometric maps of the space
* Map key showing what object each map symbol represents
* Optional: timing equipment
* Whiteboard, markers, eraser
* Orienteering maps with courses

## Introduction for Students

“Orienteering is a sport where you find things using a map drawn with symbols. Today you will use a regular orienteering map to find your way between checkpoints.”\


## Activities

1. Find Fast
   * The students run throughout the area to visit all of the checkpoints.
   * Encourage students to remember which animals are where, although they do not have to memorize them.
2. Map symbols
   * Discuss what a symbol is. What are the students’ current understanding of symbols. Explain that a symbol is something that’s used to represent something else. Highlight examples: Company logos, stick figure boys/girls on bathroom doors. Can the students think of other symbols?
   * Identify important areas and symbols on the map, and see if the students can figure out what each symbol represents. (e.g. Field = Yellow, Tree = Green dot/circle, Fence = Black line with tag marks)
   * Point to a symbol on the map and have students run out to a feature that matches the symbol (e.g. If you point to a tree symbol on the map, students should run to a tree. It does not matter which tree they run to).
3. Orienting the map
   * Ask the students to orient their maps to their surroundings (if they haven’t already).&#x20;
   * Point out that everything in real life is in the same position as shown on the map when the map is oriented. Indicate one of the checkpoints on the map that is currently visible, and demonstrate how it is the same direction in real life as indicated on the map.
   * Have students turn their maps so they are no longer oriented. Demonstrate how trying to point the same direction on the map as in real life no longer works when the map is not oriented.
   * Instruct the students to orient their maps and identify the other visible checkpoint(s) using the same process.
4. (Handicapped Orienteering Course)
   * Have the students divide into pairs or small groups.
   * Pass out an orienteering map with a course to each group. (You may also choose to pass out an isometric map without a course to groups.)
   * Tell the groups they must find the checkpoints on the orienteering map. (They may compare the orienteering map to the isometric map to help them think about where each feature is, and where the checkpoint is located in real life.)
   * Students may proceed at their own pace. Time does not matter for this activity.
5. Orienteering Courses
   * Pass out an orienteering map with a course to each group.
   * The students should work together to complete the course. If they need help, they may return to look at the isometric map, but they may not take the isometric map with them.
   * Students who wish to be competitive may keep track of their time.
   * If any groups are particularly successful, they may choose to complete orienteering courses on their own, or assist other groups who are struggling.

## Wrap-Up

* Discussion:&#x20;
  * How are the maps different from last week?
  * Why might we want to use a map using symbols instead of pictures?
  * Why do we make maps as though we’re in the sky looking down?
  * What strategies did you use to find the correct checkpoints?

## Indoor Alternative

1. Basketball-O
   * Place differently colored sheets of paper at either end of the gym (e.g. Red at one end, blue at the other). Prepare courses with checkpoints located along the lines of the basketball court. Mark each side of the map with the color corresponding to the paper at that end.
   * Have students pair up or work in small groups and pass out maps, but do not have any groups start yet.
   * Indicate the colored papers at either end of the gym, and how they match the colors on either side of the map. Have everyone turn their map so that the colors are oriented with the gym.
   * Point at individual cones around the gym. Can students indicate where each checkpoint is located on their map? Then point to a checkpoint on the map and see if they can identify which cone it matches in the gym.
   * Once students are able to orient themselves within the gym, they may begin the course.

Extension: Students may only moved along the lines of the basketball court. This will challenge the students to consider the best route to get from one place to another. Lines may also be blocked in certain areas to make selecting a route more challenging.
