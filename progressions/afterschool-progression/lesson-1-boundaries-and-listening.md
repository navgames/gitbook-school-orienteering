# Lesson 1: Boundaries and Listening

## Learning Objectives

* Behavioral expectations for the class
* Learn the boundaries of the play area
* Listening to the teacher and each other
* Safety

## Materials

* Small cones \(30+\)

## Introduction

A boundary is the edge of the safe play area. Orienteering involves running around inside an area with boundaries. The purpose of today's activities is to practice listening and learn the boundaries of the play area. Listening and boundaries are important for everyone to be safe during our activities, and so everyone understands the rules for all the games they will be playing throughout the semester.

## Warm-Up

[\(Active\) Simon Says](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fnavgames.force.com%2Factivities%2Fs%2Fdetail%2Fa2j1K0000014rMjQAI&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNExRwsjS_Zb7643us1MF1OqmNx38Q): Students practice active listening and active moving by playing an energetic game of Simon Says with the teacher.

## Main Activities:

[Boundary Run](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fnavgames.force.com%2Factivities%2Fs%2Fdetail%2Fa2j1K0000014rMyQAI&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFMHsuAZWMy3pQgZ9cQFy2ZCWsLnQ): Run around the boundary of the play area. Make sure students respect the boundary, and do not cross out of the play area.

[Fortnite Tag](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fnavgames.force.com%2Factivities%2Fs%2Fdetail%2Fa2j1K0000014rMyQAI&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFMHsuAZWMy3pQgZ9cQFy2ZCWsLnQ): Tag played within a shrinking play area. Students must remain within the area of play, even as the boundary shrinks.

[Hot or Cold Secret Boundary Game](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fnavgames.force.com%2Factivities%2Fs%2Fdetail%2Fa2j1K0000014rMyQAI&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFMHsuAZWMy3pQgZ9cQFy2ZCWsLnQ): Communicate location using a very limited vocabulary

## Reflection

Listening:

* Why is it important to listen to the teacher?
* Why is it important to listen to each other?
* What should you do if someone is talking when you're trying to listen?

Boundaries:

* See reflection in the [Boundaries activity](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fnavgames.force.com%2Factivities%2Fs%2Fdetail%2Fa2j1K0000014rMyQAI&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFMHsuAZWMy3pQgZ9cQFy2ZCWsLnQ).

## Extra Activity

Name games: Learn the kids' names. This can be as simple as "Tell us your name and your favorite animal," or more elaborate such as Duck-Duck-Goose, where the students say the names of other students as they go around \("Name-Name-Goose"\).

## Notes

Some of the students may find it humorous to test your patience and cross the boundary during some of the activities. Use this as an opportunity to firmly establish expectations in the class. If students cross the boundary even once \(even if they're only joking\), address the issue immediately. The rest of the year can be much more difficult if students believe they can freely break the rules and/or test your patience.
