# Lesson 3: Animal-O

## Learning Objectives

* Visiting controls in order
* Checking your answers
* Remembering locations
* Remembering a sequence of clues
* \(Electronic Timing\)

## Materials

* Set of 10 animal pictures
* \(Traffic\) cones
* SportIdent Equipment:
  * SI boxes
  * SI download & printer
  * SI cards
* Animal-O course cards \(5-animal & 10-animal versions\)
* Map of the area with courses \(For advanced students\)
  * Variations with checkpoints marked as animals
  * Variations with checkpoints marked as circles \(without animals\)
* Answer key
* An extra teacher/volunteer

## Intro

Orienteering is finding objects in order, and punching at each object to prove you were there. Students must find animals hidden throughout the space in various different ways. Each time they are successful, they move on to a more challenging variation, up through using an actual map.

## Warm-Up

[Gathering Game](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fnavgames.force.com%2Factivities%2Fs%2Fdetail%2Fa2j1K0000014rLlQAI&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFstMxIY9RLXhNucHlcQC3ygP6YQg) - Have the students repeat one or two of the gathering games they practiced in the previous lesson, and briefly review the importance of gathering.

## Main Activity

[Animal-O](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fnavgames.force.com%2Factivities%2Fs%2Fdetail%2Fa2j1K0000014rLCQAY&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGrxC-GHnNdodyltQtPJZ-Cj4VN1Q) - Students follow a progression of challenges by finding pictures of animals hidden throughout the play area. They start by finding animals in any order. Next they use a clue sheet that shows a specific order in which to find the animals. Eventually, they use a map to determine the order.

## Reflection

* What was the hardest part of this activity? Why?
* How did you remember where each animal was hiding?
* Were some animal courses easier/harder? Why might that be?
* \(If applicable\) What was most challenging about using a map? Were you able to figure out where each animal should be hiding?

## Extra Activity

[Lightning E-Punch](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fnavgames.force.com%2Factivities%2Fs%2Fdetail%2Fa2j1K0000014rMjQAI&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNExRwsjS_Zb7643us1MF1OqmNx38Q): Students race to each control as fast as they can.

## Notes

Some students will progress much more quickly than others, especially among younger groups. It helps to have a 3rd person available to help provide additional assistance to any students who are struggling. It is also very likely that some students will not make it all the way through the entire progression. This is not an issue, and any students who do make it all the way to the end can help other students who are struggling.

Students in the last class can help pick up the materials at the end.
