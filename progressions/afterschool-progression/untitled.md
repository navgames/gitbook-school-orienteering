# Lesson 6: Map Memory Relay

## Learning Objectives

* Precision map reading
* Map simplification
* Speed
* Agility
* Patience
* Focus
* Communication

## Materials

* Maps
  * One with 10-15 checkpoints marked
  * One of the same area without checkpoints
* Pencils
* Open space
* **OPTIONAL** \(If outside\):
  * Clipboards
  * Paper weights

## Intro

Being able to read a map is important for orienteering. Students will practice memory, patience, and teamwork as they compete to copy information from one map on to another. It is important to think about the best way to remember exactly where each checkpoint should be in order to earn the maximum score. The goal here is to be accurate rather than fast, but speed can earn your team extra points. A team who finishes last but gets every checkpoint correct will beat a team who finishes first but makes a few small mistakes.

## Warm-Up

[Roboter](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fnavgames.force.com%2Factivities%2Fs%2Fdetail%2Fa2j1K0000014rMjQAI&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNExRwsjS_Zb7643us1MF1OqmNx38Q): Students work in groups of three to reunite two lost robots. Two students will move like robots, walking in straight lines unless given direction. The third student must direct the two robots back together by running back and forth to steer them.

## Main Activity

[Map-Memory Relay](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fnavgames.force.com%2Factivities%2Fs%2Fdetail%2Fa2j1K0000014rMPQAY&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFZ-nvOZqoWPVlp_j5qvEzGfSnnZg): Students work in pairs to copy checkpoints from one map on to another. They take turns to memorize a single checkpoint each time, and will be scored based on how accurately they copy the checkpoint on to their own map. 

## Reflection

* How did you memorize the checkpoints? What features did you use? Did some work better than others?
* What was the hardest part about memorizing each checkpoint?
* How did your team ensure each person was memorizing a new checkpoint each time, and not repeating one by accident?
* If you made any mistakes, or forgot where your checkpoint was supposed to go, when do you think the gap in your memory occurred? Was it immediately after leaving the marked map, in-between the maps, or when you went to mark the checkpoint on your own map?
* What strategies can you use to keep from forgetting the checkpoint's location moving from one map to another?

## Extra Activity

[Partner Treasure Hunt \(Pictures\)](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fnavgames.force.com%2Factivities%2Fs%2Fdetail%2Fa2j1K0000014rMoQAI&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEQGDKof_GdmYFfwwiLGHAYzjs_og): Students repeat the treasure hunt game, but this time they will draw a picture on a blank piece of paper for where they hid the treasure. Their partner must then attempt to use the picture to find the treasure.

## Notes

Make sure to provide a demonstration before beginning the activity so that all students understand how the relay works. Also provide examples of good circles \(small & accurate\) and bad circles \(large and/or messy\). Make sure they understand that accuracy is scored higher than speed, but speed can earn bonus points. Also watch to make sure the students trade off each time, and it's not just one student running back and forth while their partner watches.
