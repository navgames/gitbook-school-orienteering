# Acknowledgments



Navigation Games has benefited from an enormous amount of support and advice over the years, which influenced the design of these lessons. Cambridge Public School teachers Linda Fobes and Julia Bishop advised Navigation Games on lesson plan development and welcomed us into their classrooms. We are grateful to all the Navigation Games staff who contributed to our approach to teaching orienteering over the years. We also thank coaches and members of Orienteering USA, the New England Orienteering Club, and Cambridge Sports Union.
