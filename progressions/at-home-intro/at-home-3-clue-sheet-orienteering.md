### **Introduction**

"Today we will make **clue sheets** and use them to find **checkpoints** on a course. Each course will have a different **clue sheet**. Your challenge will be to find the fastest route for each course."

### **Learning Goals**

* Following a sequence
* Spatial Memory
* Vocabulary
  * **Route**: the path you take to get to all the objects
  * **Course**: a set of objects to visit in order, along with a start and finish location
  * **Symbol**: an abstract shape or character that represents a type of feature
  * **Clue sheet**: a list of symbols telling you which objects to visit, and in what order
  * **Checkpoint**: A landmark or significant location in the space

### **Materials**

* 5 Objects: These should be easy to see, approximately the size of a stuffed animal or larger.
* Paper
* Pencil
* Scissors
* A Partner

### Safety

Do not run with scissors. Remember when passing scissors to others to hold them with the sharp ends pointing toward yourself, not the other person.

Pay attention when moving through the space so you don't hurt yourself or break anything.

### Activity

* **Set Up**
  * Identify 5 unique objects in the space. These can be anything from a table or TV to a stuffed animal or plate of cookies. These objects will be your **checkpoints**.
  * Choose a **symbol** to represent each object. Example symbols are shown on the clue sheets below. Write down the object that each symbol represents.
  * Create **clue sheets**. Cut a piece of paper into strips. Draw symbols in different orders on each strip. Each strip should include 1 of each **symbol**, although the order should be different for each one.
  * _Here are some example clue sheets_:

* Game 1: **Clue Sheet Orienteering**
  * For each **clue sheet**, the objective is to visit the checkpoints in the order they appear on the sheet. Record your time for each course.
  * Once you're completed all courses, run them again and see if your time improves.
  * Try running a course from memory.

### Reflection

1. Did the activity get easier over time? Why might this be?
2. Were some courses easier than others?
3. Without looking, can you describe where each object is?

### Do More

* Try moving around some of the objects between each round. How does the game grow more difficult as the number of objects moved increases?
* **Symbol Clue Sheet Orienteering**
  * First create a symbol for each of your objects, and Indicate which symbol matches each object. For example, a stuffed animal can be represented with a triangle, or a TV can be a square. This list of symbols is your key.
  * Create **clue sheets** similar to the ones you used for Clue Sheet Orienteering, but this time use the symbols instead of images or words.
  * Complete courses with the new **clue sheets** in the same manner as the Clue Sheet Orienteering game.
* This activity can be done outdoors as well.
