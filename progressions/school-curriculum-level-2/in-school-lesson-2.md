## Learning Goals

### SHAPE America Standards:

* S.3.E4.3 Recognizes the importance of warm-up and cool down physical activity
* S4.E4.3a Works cooperatively with others
* S4.E5.3 Recognizes the role of rules and etiquette in physical activity with peers
* S5.E4.3 Describes the positive social interactions that come when engaged with others in physical activity

### Standards Based Objectives

Students will be able to:

* “Build a mental map” by remembering locations of checkpoints
* Describe a map using orienteering specific vocabulary
* Orient a map using skills and strategies from previous orienteering lessons
* Successfully navigate a course by using a map
* Understand that orienteering involves not only visiting checkpoints in order, but also timing
* Design their own course on a map using landmarks and orienteering vocabulary

## Materials and Set-Up

* Large isometric map drawing
* 10 Animal picture cones
* 5-animal and 10-animal picture cards
* SportIdent equipment
* Place cones at distinct “landmarks” throughout the space

## Introduction for Students

“Orienteering is a sport where you use a map to find locations marked by controls. Today you will start by finding animals in order, and then show me where those animals are on a drawing of the park/school grounds.”

## Activities

1. Find Fast
   * The students run throughout the area to visit all of the checkpoints.
   * Encourage students to remember which animals are where, although they do not have to memorize them.
2. Review the homework from Lesson 1
3. Animal-O
   * \(This is the same as the previous week, although the cones are scattered throughout the entire area.\)
4. Feature Sprints
   * Show students the isometric map of the space. Discuss how the map matches their surroundings, so everything on the map matches something in real life.
   * Have students try to identify where they currently are on the map. Can anyone explain how they know?
   * Pick a specific feature on map. This feature should be distinct and nearby. Discuss the feature, and where it is in relation to where you are now. Can the class point out the corresponding feature in real life? \(Vice versa: Can you point at an object in real life, and have students identify where it is on the map?\)
   * Once the class knows which feature you picked, have everyone run there and back.
   * Repeat the process 2 or 3 times, but each time give them less help in identifying where the feature is in real life, and pick more challenging features.
   * Ask whether anyone can point out the location of one of the animal cones. Repeat through several of the animal cones.
   * Extension: Have one of the students pick out a feature for everyone to find. Can they tell if everyone went to the right spot or not?
5. Hand out the homework from Lesson 2 \(a black and white map drawing; students can choose whether to color it in or identify three things that are missing or wrong\). Tell them we will discuss this homework next time.

## Wrap-Up

* Discussion: 
  * Was it ever challenging to keep your map matching the cones? Why was that? 
  * What happened if the map was no longer oriented to match the cones? Why does it make a difference?
  * Did you change anything about how you moved to make sure your map always faced the correct direction?
  * How could you tell if you were in the right place or not?
  * What sort of mistakes did people make? Why did those mistakes occur? How did you figure out what to do after making a mistake?
