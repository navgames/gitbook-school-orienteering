## Learning Goals

### SHAPE America Standards:&#x20;

* S1.E2.3 Travels showing differentiation between sprinting and running
* S4.E4.3a Works cooperatively with others
* S4.E4.3b Praises others for their success in movement performance
* S4.E5.3 Recognizes the role of rules and etiquette in physical activity with peers
* S4.E6.3 Works independently and safely in physical activity settings
* S5.E4.3 Describes the positive social interactions that come when engaged with others in physical activity

### Standards Based Objectives:

Students will be able to:

* Use a map drawing for navigating a course
* Execute all steps of an orienteering course, including clear, start, visit controls in order, finish, download, assess errors.
* Relate objects on a drawing to symbols on a map
* Identify and define symbols on an orienteering map

## Materials and Set-Up

* Isometric maps of the school grounds or a local park with a variety of basic courses
  * Isometric maps with 5 checkpoints each
  * Place checkpoints as shown on the map
  * Regular orienteering maps as well if available&#x20;
* Extension: Poison score-O course using the same maps
* Orienteering flags or other suitable markers
* Optional: timing equipment
* Optional: whiteboard for a leaderboard

## Introduction for Students

“Orienteering is a sport where you use a map to find marked locations. Today you will use a picture map to find checkpoints in order and complete a real orienteering course.”\


## Activities

1. Find Fast
   * The students run throughout the area to visit all of the checkpoints.
   * Encourage students to remember which animals are where, although they do not have to memorize them.
2. Orienteering course on the isometric map
   * Assign students to work in pairs. (Groups of 3 are fine if there is an odd number.)
   * Pass out maps with a course. Make sure at least two checkpoints on the map are visible from the start/finish (does not have to be the first two checkpoints; any two will do).&#x20;
   * Have the students identify where they are on the map. (Ideally this would be the starting triangle). Ask them to describe how they know their location.&#x20;
   * Point out one of the visible checkpoints in terrain and ask whether they can identify it on their map. Demonstrate how features and directions match up when the map is oriented.
   * Students complete a course working together. Students may choose to repeat a course or try a new one regardless of whether or not they make mistakes. If a group does make mistakes, review with them which checkpoints they visited, which one they were looking for, and how they can tell the difference.
   * (If a group is successful, they may be given the option to complete additional courses individually, or assist other groups in need of help.)
   * Extension: Keep a leaderboard of the fastest times on each course for students who wish to compete. Make sure students know that competing against others is an option, and they may choose to complete their courses without keeping track of their time if they wish.
3. Extension: Poison Score-O (if extra time)
   * Place a large number of checkpoints (10-25), but mark only \~½ - ⅔ of them on the map.
   * Students must visit only the checkpoints shown on the map. For each correct checkpoint, they gain +1 point. For each incorrect checkpoint, they lose -1 point. Challenge them to achieve the highest possible score.
4. Compare drawing to map
   * Show students an orienteering map of the space with an isometric map right beside it. Point out to the students that both maps show the same space. Can anyone point out similarities between the maps? Differences?
   * Try pointing at a feature on the orienteering map, and see if the students can find the corresponding feature on the isometric map. Repeat this several times.
   * Try pointing at a feature again, but this time point to a feature on the isometric map, and have students find the corresponding feature on the orienteering map. Repeat several times.

## Wrap-Up

* Discussion
  * What is easy about using a map to find things in real life?
  * What was hard about finding things in real life using the map?
  * If the colors on the maps were different, would the map still work?
  * If the shapes on the map were different, but always in the same place (e.g. A tree becomes a triangle), would the map still be usable? Why or why not?
